                    <p>One of the most important things to consider when buying fancy coloured diamonds is colour intensity. Naturally coloured diamonds which have an intense, vivid colour, are usually more valuable and deemed more desirable than diamonds which have a lighter hue.</p>
                    <p>Naturally coloured diamonds are found in a range of colour strengths. The rarest and most expensive fancy coloured diamonds are those which have an intense or vivid colour.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fancy light:</strong> This is the lightest intensity that we offer. Fancy light yellow diamonds have a pale yellow hue and they are more affordable than other tones.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fancy:</strong> Fancy yellow diamonds have a very clear yellow hue. They usually are a popular choice and priced on average the same as a similar good quality colourless diamond.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fancy intense:</strong> Fancy intense diamonds have a pure and clear yellow hue and they are less expensive than fancy vivid diamonds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fancy vivid:</strong> This is the most vibrant yellow diamond we offer. Fancy vivid yellow diamonds are rare and, therefore, more expensive.</p>
