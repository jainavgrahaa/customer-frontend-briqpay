Higher quality diamonds will have a pure, bright white appearance, whereas those lower in quality will have noticeable colour. To the untrained eye, this can be tricky to spot. In the mid-1950s the Gemological Institute of America devised a colour grade scale between D-Z, to regulate and define the colour spectrum of diamonds. With D being completely colourless and Z being slightly yellow or brown in appearance. The colour of the diamond has a huge impact on its value. However, this rule is not to be confused with coloured diamonds. Coloured diamonds are graded on a separate diamond colour scale and can even be more rare or valuable than the diamond."} />
